# 🌅 Generative AI Prompt Lab – Emotional Rewriting with IBM Cloud

This project explores the capabilities of IBM's **watsonx.ai Prompt Lab** to perform **emotionally rich and poetic rewriting** of descriptive text using foundation models. It demonstrates how well large language models (LLMs) can enhance and beautify human language through prompt engineering.

---

## 🧠 Objective

To "train" the model's behavior using **prompt engineering** — not through code, but by crafting precise system instructions and sample inputs — so that it consistently rewrites descriptive sentences with a vivid, poetic tone.

## ✍️ Prompt Tests

### 📌 Input 1
As the sun dipped below the horizon, casting golden hues across the quiet ocean, he sat on the weathered wooden dock with a notebook in hand, trying to capture in words the bittersweet feeling of watching something so beautiful knowing it would disappear within moments.


**✅ Output:**
Bathed in golden twilight as the sun kissed the ocean's edge, he lingered on the timeworn dock, pen in hand, chasing words that might hold the aching beauty of a fleeting moment destined to fade.

---

### 📌 Input 2
The flickering candlelight cast dancing shadows on the old library walls as she flipped through the fragile, yellowed pages of a forgotten diary, each word pulling her deeper into a story that felt eerily familiar.

**✅ Output:**
In the hush of the ancient library, where candlelight danced upon weathered walls, she turned the delicate, aged pages of a lost diary, each word weaving a tale that echoed with an unsettling familiarity.
